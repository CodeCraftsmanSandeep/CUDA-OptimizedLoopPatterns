This repository presents state-of-the-art memory access patterns tailored for CUDA applications. It extends the widely adopted grid-stride access paradigm with innovative techniques that enhance memory coalescence, spatial locality, and load balancing, while minimizing warp divergence.

## Overview

Efficient global memory access is crucial in GPU computing. Our implementation extends traditional grid-stride loops by incorporating block-stride and warp-stride techniques to achieve:
- **Maximized memory coalescing**
- **Enhanced spatial locality for each CUDA thread**
- **Even workload distribution and efficient load balancing**
- **Minimal warp divergence (at most one divergence per warp)**

These improvements directly translate into superior performance for reduction operations and can be readily applied to other HPC kernels.

## Key Features

| Feature                                | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coalesced Memory Access**            | Optimizes memory transactions for maximum throughput.                                             |
| **Improved Spatial Locality**          | Enhances data access patterns compared to conventional grid-stride methods.                         |
| **Efficient Load Balancing**           | Ensures even distribution of work across threads to eliminate idle cycles.                         |
| **Minimal Warp Divergence**            | Limits divergence to a maximum of one per warp, preserving parallel efficiency.                     |

## Compilation and Execution

### Building the Code

To compile the implementations, use the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`). For example, to compile the block-stride tree reduction, run:

```bash
nvcc -arch=sm_75 ourImplementations/efficientStridePatterns/blockStrideTreeReduction.cu ourImplementations/src.cu -o ourImplementations/efficientStridePatterns/blockStrideTreeReduction.out
```

> **Note:** Replace `sm_75` with the appropriate compute capability for your GPU if necessary.

### Running the Executable

After compilation, you can run the executable as follows:

```bash
./ourImplementations/efficientStridePatterns/blockStrideTreeReduction.out < input > output
```

- Standard sizes which we considered for benchmarking:
    - For one array only: (all are X 1e7) array size is
        - 0.37
        - 1.00
        - 9.00
        - 17.00
        - 49.00
        - 73.00
        - 113.00
        - 153.00
        - 195.00
        - 211.00
    - For two arrays: (all array sizes are X 1e7) each array size is
        - 0.20
        - 1.00
        - 10.00
        - 40.00
        - 60.00
        - 80.00
        - 100.00
        - 125.00

## Benchmark Results

Below is a summary of benchmark performance comparing our optimized implementations with traditional grid-stride loops and Thrust-based reductions:

| Implementation                           | Speedup vs. Grid-Stride | Speedup vs. Thrust Reduction |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------:|-----------------------------:|
| **Warp-Strided Reduction**               |            **+50%**      |            **+18%**          |
| Block-Strided Reduction                  |            +25%         |            _              |
| Traditional Grid-Stride Reduction        |             Baseline     |            Baseline          |
